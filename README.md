## CENTERING PAGE

1. All the content should be wrapped inside a container.
2. Children elements should not get bigger than the parent container's width.
3. We put margin left and right to auto, so the page content will alwas be centered.
   margin: 0 auto;
4. children can break the width of parent, if child has greater width than parent.

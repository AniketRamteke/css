# BOX TYPES

## Block-Level

1. Elements formatted visually as blocks
2. 100% of parent's width
3. Vertically, one after another
4. Box-model applies as showed

## Inline

1. Occupies only content's space
2. Causes no line breaks
3. Box model is different: heights and widths do not apply
4. Paddings apply on all sides
5. Margin applies only on horizontal

## Inline-Block

1. Looks like _inline_ from outside, behaves like block-level from _outside_
2. Occupies only content's space
3. Cause no line breaks
4. Box-model applies (we can set heights and width)

### NOTES:

1. images are _inline-block_ elements
2. we can chain psuedo classes one after other

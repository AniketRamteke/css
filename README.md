# POSITIONING

## Normal Flow

1. position: relative
2. in flow - elements are simply laid out acc. to their order in HTML code

## Absolute

1. position: absolute
2. Element break out of normal flow
3. No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
4. We use top, bottom, left, rightto offset the element from its relatively positioned container

### NOTES:

1. absolute element is with relation to the instant parent element whose position is relative
